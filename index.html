<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
TDK Research & Consulting is a translational biomedical research group founded by
<strong>Dr. Thomas Kazmirchuk</strong>. We develop artificial-intelligence–designed peptides
to diagnose and correct dysfunctional blood clotting in rare and acquired bleeding disorders.
</p>

<p>
Our work integrates computational protein design, platelet biology, and clinical hematology to
create precision tools that target disease-causing protein–protein interactions that
conventional drugs cannot reach.
</p>

<p>
Our flagship program focuses on platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD), a paradoxical
bleeding disorder driven by gain-of-function mutations in the platelet receptor GPIbα.
Using our AI-guided discovery platform (InSiPS), we design molecular tools that selectively
disrupt pathological platelet–VWF interactions while preserving normal hemostasis.
</p>

<h2>Research Program</h2>
<p>
Blood clotting is governed by a network of protein–protein interactions that must be precisely
balanced: too little causes bleeding, too much causes thrombosis. Many bleeding disorders arise
not from missing proteins, but from misregulated molecular binding events that current therapies
cannot selectively correct.
</p>

<p>
Our research centers on the molecular interface between platelets and von Willebrand factor (VWF),
with a focus on how gain-of-function mutations in platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) distort clot
architecture and stability. In platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD), enhanced
platelet–VWF binding paradoxically produces fragile clots that disintegrate under shear.
</p>

<p>
By combining structural biology, biophysics, and artificial-intelligence–guided peptide design,
TDK Research develops tools that directly interrogate and modulate these pathological interfaces,
establishing a new paradigm for precision treatment of bleeding disorders.

<h2>In-Silico Protein Synthesizer (InSiPS)</h2>
<p>
InSiPS is an AI-guided peptide discovery platform developed at TDK Research & Consulting to generate
short, highly specific peptides that bind pathological protein interfaces with diagnostic and
therapeutic precision.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Targets flat and extended protein surfaces</li>
<li>Disrupts disease-specific binding events</li>
<li>Preserves normal physiological interactions</li>
</ul>

<p>
In PT-VWD and related disorders, InSiPS has produced peptide candidates that selectively recognize
mutant platelet–VWF complexes, enabling both mechanistic insight and translational applications.
</p>
